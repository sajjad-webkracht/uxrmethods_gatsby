A/B Testing, also known as split testing, is a method used to compare two versions of a webpage, email, or other digital asset to determine which one performs better. In this process, users are randomly divided into two groups, with each group interacting with a different version (Version A and Version B).Â By analyzing user behavior and performance metrics, such as click-through rates or conversions, A/B testing helps identify which version is more effective in achieving the desired outcome.
